# dimensionality_reduction_assignment

## The chosen image dataset for dimensionality reduction was sign language dataset.

PCA did not work quite well in categorizing the different signs. Chose number of dimensions as 2 and 3. As seen from the above the graph the clusters were not separated that much. The execution time was the best.

TSNE worked better on separating the clusters than PCA as seen from the graph above. However, the execution time was ~116s.

UMAP turned out to be the most effective in terms of displaying the different clusters with clear separations. The execution time was ~

SVD did not work well in separating out the clusters. Although the excution time was little better ~32s.

ISOMAP worked better than PCA and SVD in separating out the clusters. The execution time was ~76s



## The chosen tabular dataset for dimensionality reduction was breast cancer dataset.

PCA worked better for tabular dataset in giving separate clusters.

TSNE worked better on separating the clusters than PCA as seen from the graph above.

UMAP turned out to be the most effective in terms of displaying the different clusters with clear separations.

SVD did not work well in separating out the clusters.

ISOMAP worked better than PCA and SVD in separating out the clusters.

LLE also did a good job in sepearting out clusters.
